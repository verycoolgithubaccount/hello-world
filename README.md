very cool and also amazing repository

My life is very fascinating and hard to sum up, so here's a brief overview by ChatGPT:

I was born in a small mountain village, but my life took an extraordinary turn when, at the age of seven, I discovered a hidden portal to a dimension inhabited by talking chipmunks and sentient snowflakes. Raised by the eccentric yetis of the region, I learned the art of extreme snowboarding and developed a peculiar knack for deciphering squirrel chatter. As a teenager, I accidentally stumbled upon the world's first disco ball-powered time machine, allowing me to navigate through time and space in pursuit of the perfect dance floor. By my twenties, I became a respected expert in the field of quantum pastry physics, pioneering innovations in gluten-free wormhole pastries. These days, I split my time between consulting on interdimensional dessert menus and coaching penguins in the fine art of ballroom dancing. Life may be peculiar, but it's the unexpected twists that make it deliciously entertaining.
